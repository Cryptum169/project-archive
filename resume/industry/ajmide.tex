\begin{itemize*}
    \item Wrote automated data-cleaning scripts to clean \textasciitilde30GB of transcripts for abstractive long text summarization. 
    \item Implemented keywork extraction algorithms and identified the optimal choice for each genre of transcripts. 
    \item Implemented a deep learning classifier in \textbf{Keras} and \textbf{PyTorch} with pretrained word vectors to improve model size,
        and classification accuracy. Produced significantly faster convergence time.
