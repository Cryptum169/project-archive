\begin{itemize*}
    \item \textbf{Perception space navigation} to reduces planning time and computation complexity for mobile and computationally limited platforms. 
    \item Develop \textbf{local planning} algorithm that \textbf{directly plans in RGB-D sensor inputs},
        benchmarked and evaluated in simulated Gazebo environment with
        monte-carlo rollouts  with randomly populated obstacles, start, and goals.
    \item Developed a framework for benchmarking planner timings including execution rate, time, and message delays to evaluate
        between stages of planning.
    \item Transformed existing optimal local planner \emph{Timed Elastic Band} to use \textbf{perception space representation}.
