	\begin{itemize*}
		\item Deployed monocular \textbf{visual inertial odometry} on lightweight aerial vehicles with limited sensor quality and highly nonlinear dynamics.
		\item Developed image denoising and partial rejection framework, and modified DSO to achieve stable performance.
		\item Assessed system robustness to handle significant drift-free rotation and noisy image on self-collected datsets. 
	\end{itemize*}
