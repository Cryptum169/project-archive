\begin{itemize*}
    \item Highway driving scenarios using stochastic model predictive control for \textbf{uncertain agent interactions}.
    \item Developed a framework for recursively update belief of interaction in agents and represented as chance-constraint.
    \item Wrote MATLAB script for simulation environment and controller design, average planning rate of \textasciitilde5Hz.
    \item Rewrote to \textbf{JuliaLang} with Convex.jl and JuMP.jl for performance enhancement analysis.
\end{itemize*}
