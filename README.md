## Automating my Resume and CV
In an effort to automate my LaTeX cv and resume, I made them hiearchial with conditional compilation.
Hopefully they don't deprecate too fast.

Also I can make this into a custom LaTeX template I suppose. But that requires effort, so maybe at a later time.

[Resume](resume/resume.pdf), and [CV](resume/cv.pdf).
