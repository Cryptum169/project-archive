## Automating my Resume and CV
In an effort to automate my LaTeX cv and resume, I made them hiearchial with conditional compilation.
Hopefully they don't deprecate too fast.

Also hopefully I can make this into a custom class. But that requires effort, so maybe at a later time.

[Resume](resume/resume.pdf), and [CV](resume/cv.pdf). Hopefully it is not a bad choice to put up the source code.
